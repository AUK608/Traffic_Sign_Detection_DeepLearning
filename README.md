# Traffic_Sign_Detection_DeepLearning
This repository is for German Traffic Sign Detection using Ultralytics YOLOv8

This repository contains implementation in the form of jupyter notebook(.ipynb). Every cell in the notebook has information comments which can help the user to understand the code better.

The Inputs and Outputs are zipped and kept separately.

The References to Inputs, Codes, Issues, Solutions, etc., are kept in text files.
